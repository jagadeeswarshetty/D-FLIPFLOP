--> D Flip-Flop Explanation

A D Flip-Flop (Data or Delay Flip-Flop) is a memory element that stores 1 bit of data.

It captures the value of the input D only on the active edge of the clock (rising or falling, depending on design).

The output Q then holds this value until the next active clock edge.

Working Principle

When the clock edge comes:

If D = 1 → then Q becomes 1.

If D = 0 → then Q becomes 0.

At other times (between clock edges), the output remains stable.

Truth Table (Positive Edge Triggered)

Clock Edge	D	Q(next)
↑ (rising)	0	0
↑ (rising)	1	1
no edge	X	Q(prev)

X means "don’t care".

Q(prev) means output stays unchanged.

Key Points

Acts like a 1-bit register.

Used in counters, shift registers, memory units.

Eliminates the problem of uncertain states in SR Flip-Flop.
